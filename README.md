There are **52!** different permutations of a deck of cards.

That's **80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000**.

In other words, it's *a lot*, so if you shuffled a deck of cards right now, chances are you've discovered a permutation that has never been seen before.

In fact, if you've been shuffling cards every second since you were born, you still probably wouldn't get the same permutation twice. Even if you've been shuffling cards every second since *the beginning of the universe*, it's still unlikely.

That's where this project comes in, what if we could have a computer, or lots of computers, simulating the shuffling of cards and storing the results until we find a permutation we've found before. A computer can simulate a shuffle much faster than a human can, so how long would it take?
